# 1Password Vault

Requires a minimum of Python3.9

## Prerequisites

You must create a Service Account for the 1Password vault/vaults you are trying to access. You can follow the [Getting Started with Service Accounts](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts/get-started/) to assist with creating the Service Account.

!!! note
    The Service Account token needs to have access to the Vault that it is configured for. Per 1Password policy "You can't grant a service account access to your built-in Personal, Private, or Employee vault, or your default Shared vault."

## Configuration

You must provide a mapping in `PLUGINS_CONFIG` within your `nautobot_config.py`, for example:

```python
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "nautobot_secrets_providers": {
        "one_password": {
            "token": os.environ.get("OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN"),
            "vaults": {
                "MyVault": {
                    "token": os.environ.get("OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN"),
                },
            },
        },
    },
}
```

- `token` - (required) The 1Password Service Account Token to be used globally when it is not specified by a vault.
- `vaults` (required) Each 1Password Vault that is supported by this app will be listed inside this dictionary.
  - `<vault_name>` (required) The name of the vault needs to be placed as a key inside the `vaults` dictionary.
    - `token` (optional) The 1Password Service Account Token to be used by the above vault, if overriding the global `token`.
