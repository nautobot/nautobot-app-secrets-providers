# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I add custom secrets providers?

Nautobot supports adding custom secrets providers natively. If you'd like to write your own secret provider you should create a new custom Nautobot app instead of forking this app. See the [App Development Secrets Providers](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/development/apps/api/platform-features/secrets-providers) documentation for more information.
