# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I add custom secrets providers?

Nautobot supports adding custom secrets providers natively. If you'd like to write your own secret provider (and do not wish to contribute it to this App, for whatever reason), you can create a new custom Nautobot app instead of forking this app. See the [App Development Secrets Providers](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/development/apps/api/platform-features/secrets-providers) documentation for more information.
